                                    Toxic Comment Classification on a Broad Data Set


ABSTRACT: 

A Random Forest Classifier is used to identify
different types of toxic comments from a data set.
In addition to this, the positive affection of the
performance of this algorithm by using parameter
optimization is described. The optimized Random
Forest Classifier is tested on whether it is possible
for the algorithm to become a proper and useful
toxic comment filter for day-to-day users. After
conducting the test it was determined that the
results were inconclusive and it is not possible
for this model to become a proper toxic comment
filter for the specified user group.
