    "# NLP Project - Toxic Comment Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is used for the detection of toxic comments in a given dataset -https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge-. The decision was made to use a RandomForrest model to predict whether a comment is, primarily, toxic; but is also trained to derive whether a comment is: Severely toxic, obscene, a threat, an insult and/or identity hate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code begins with importing all the relevant libraries, where the RandomForestClassifier from the sklearn library is the main player. After the importation of all the libraries, a function is defined called: cleanText. The function takes the text which has to be cleaned as its input, where after it will start to clean the text as follows:\n",
    "- First  the stopword are imported from the default nltk.corpus where the 'english' stopwords are selected while we deal with -mostly- an English text;\n",
    "- The decision was made to whitelist the following words: 'not','you','your','you're' and are. This while not is a negation and will make a toxic comment untoxic by negating the toxidity and the variations of you while this indicates a direction against someone which is usually used when swearing;\n",
    "- The text is transformed to only be lowercase so we do not have to deal with capital letters, this was also found to lack improvement in our accuracy;\n",
    "- English abbreviations are also subbed in order to get the full spelling;\n",
    "- the stopwords are deleted from the text -of course without the whitelisted words-;\n",
    "- all the numerals are deleted from the data, this while you can hardly be toxic by using numbers;\n",
    "- punctuation is deleted;\n",
    "- in the final step the word tokens are joined together to get back to the original data form.\n"

    "With having a clean dataset the first step is completed towards implementing the randomForestClassifier. However, more preparation has to be done. The problem stands that the RandomForestClassifier -from here on to be abbreviated as RFC- needs an input of floats and the current dataFrame only holds strings as an input. Thus, in a way, these strings have to be converted to floats. In this case, the choice was made to do this by using a word2vec model from the Gensim library. Word2Vec will give a vector value to every word in the dataset, in order to make this useful for the dataset the average value of all vectors in a sentence is taken such that we have one value representing every sentence.
